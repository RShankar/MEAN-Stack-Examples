This covers examples from "Node.JS in Action by Young, Meck, and Cantelon," 2nd edition, published by Manning. 

Some of the examples are stand-alone JS code. Here is info on debuggers: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_debugging.asp - however,
it is much easier to invoke node with the name of the js file in Git Bash. It will run simpler non-server code also. 

Chapter 2 on Node programming fundamentals requires a good understanding of certain Node APIs, viz., Console, File System, HTTP, 
and Modules. URL: https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/
