Here is the standard procedure: in Git Bash, mkdir <module_name>, cd <module_name>, type npm init -y and enter. Go to Atom IDE and create
the necessary js files. In Git Bash, type node <main.js> file, whichever is the main.js file. For example in Listing of section 2.3, 
it would be test_currency.js
Listing in section 2.2.1 does not work. 
Listing in section, based on module/class construction and module.exports,  2.3 works
